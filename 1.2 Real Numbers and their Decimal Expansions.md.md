  

**Concept**

  

When performing long division to convert a fraction to decimal form, pay close attention to three critical elements:

  

1. The sequence of remainders that appear

2. Whether these remainders eventually become zero

3. Whether these remainders start repeating in a pattern

  

These observations will lead us to a fundamental classification of all rational numbers.

  
  

### The Two Types of Decimal Expansions for Rational Numbers

  

**Concept**

  

Every rational number falls into exactly one of two categories based on its decimal expansion. Understanding this classification is crucial for mastering real number concepts.

  

### **Type 1: Terminating Decimals**

  

Some rational numbers produce decimal expansions that end after a finite number of digits. We call these **terminating decimals**. They occur when, during the division process, the remainder eventually becomes zero.

  

**Example:** Consider the fraction $\frac{7}{8}$. When we perform the division:

- We divide 7.000... by 8

- After a few steps, the remainder becomes zero

- The decimal expansion is 0.875, which ends after three decimal places

  

**Other examples of terminating decimals:**

- $\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$

- $\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$

- $\frac{157}{40} = 3.925$

  

The key characteristic is that the decimal representation has a definite end point.

### **Type 2: Non-Terminating Recurring Decimals**

  

The second type of rational number produces decimal expansions that never end, but they exhibit a special repeating pattern. These are called **non-terminating recurring (or repeating) decimals**.

  

In these cases, during division:

- The remainder never becomes zero

- The remainders start repeating in a cycle

- This causes the digits in the quotient to repeat in a predictable pattern

  

**Example:** Consider $\frac{5}{6}$. The division produces 0.8333333..., where the digit 3 repeats endlessly. We write this as $0.8\overline{3}$, where the bar over 3 indicates it repeats forever.

  

**Another example:** $\frac{2}{11} = 0.181818...$ which we write as $0.\overline{18}$, showing that the block "18" repeats infinitely.

  

---

  

• What is the difference between terminating and non-terminating decimals?

  

• Why do some fractions give terminating decimals while others don't?

  

• How do we represent repeating decimals using bar notation?

  

**Extra Learning Box:**

  

The bar notation (vinculum) over digits indicates infinite repetition. For example, $0.\overline{3}$ means 0.333... forever, and $0.\overline{142857}$ means the block "142857" repeats infinitely. This notation was developed to write infinite decimals in a compact form.

## Why Do Remainders Repeat?

  

**Concept**

  

When dividing any integer by another integer (say dividing by $n$), there are only a limited number of possible remainders - specifically, remainders from 0 to $n-1$.

  

**Example:** When dividing by 7, the only possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's just seven possibilities.

  

Since there are only finitely many possible remainders, but the division process might continue indefinitely, one of two things must happen:

  

1. You eventually get a remainder of zero → **terminating decimal**

2. You must eventually see the same remainder again → **recurring decimal**

  

When a remainder repeats, everything that follows will be identical to what happened before, creating a repeating cycle.

  

---

  

## The Fundamental Property of Rational Numbers

  

**Concept**

  

**Theorem:** The decimal expansion of any rational number is either:

- **Terminating**, OR

- **Non-terminating but recurring (repeating)**

  

**Converse:** Any number with a terminating or non-terminating recurring decimal expansion is rational.

  

This gives us a powerful test: **A number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion terminates or repeats.**

  

| **Decimal Type** | **Example** | **Notation** | **Rational?** |

|---|---|---|---|

| Terminating | $0.625$ | Plain decimal | Yes |

| Recurring (single digit) | $0.333...$ | $0.\overline{3}$ | Yes |

| Recurring (block) | $0.142857142857...$ | $0.\overline{142857}$ | Yes |

| Non-terminating, non-recurring | $0.101001000100001...$ | No bar notation | No (Irrational) |

## Converting Decimals to Fractions

  

**Concept**

  

### **Method 1: Converting Terminating Decimals**

  

Terminating decimals are straightforward to convert. The method relies on understanding place value.

  

**Steps:**

1. Count how many decimal places there are

2. Write the decimal as a fraction with denominator $10^n$ (where $n$ is the number of decimal places)

3. Simplify the fraction

  

**Example:** $2.375$ has three decimal places, so:

  

$$2.375 = \frac{2375}{1000} = \frac{19}{8}$$

  

---

  

### **Method 2: Converting Recurring Decimals - The Algebraic Trick**

  

For recurring decimals, we use an elegant algebraic technique.

  

**Strategy:**

1. Let $x$ equal the recurring decimal

2. Multiply $x$ by an appropriate power of 10 to shift the decimal point

3. Subtract to eliminate the repeating part

4. Solve for $x$

  

This technique works beautifully, as we'll see in our examples section.

  

## Solved Examples

  
  

### **Example 1: Converting $0.\overline{3}$ to a Fraction**

  

**Problem:** Express $0.333333...$ (written as $0.\overline{3}$) in the form $\frac{p}{q}$

  

**Solution:**

  

Let $x = 0.\overline{3} = 0.333333...$

  

Since one digit repeats, multiply both sides by $10^1 = 10$:

$$10x = 3.333333...$$

  

Now subtract the first equation from the second:

$$10x - x = 3.333333... - 0.333333...$$

$$9x = 3$$

$$x = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$$

  

**Verification:** $\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}$

  

**Hence, $0.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}$**

  

***

  

### **Example 2: Converting $0.\overline{45}$ to a Fraction**

  

**Problem:** Express $0.454545...$ (written as $0.\overline{45}$) as $\frac{p}{q}$

  

**Solution:**

  

Let $x = 0.\overline{45} = 0.454545...$

  

The repeating block "45" has 2 digits, so multiply by $10^2 = 100$:

$$100x = 45.454545...$$

  

Now subtract:

$$100x - x = 45.454545... - 0.454545...$$

$$99x = 45$$

$$x = \frac{45}{99}$$

  

Simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCD (which is 9):

$$x = \frac{45 \div 9}{99 \div 9} = \frac{5}{11}$$

  

**Verification:** $\frac{5}{11} = 0.\overline{45}$ ✓

  

**Hence, $0.\overline{45} = \frac{5}{11}$**

  

***

  

### **Example 3: Converting $0.\overline{142857}$ to a Fraction**

  

**Problem:** Express $0.142857142857...$ (written as $0.\overline{142857}$) as a fraction

  

**Solution:**

  

Let $x = 0.\overline{142857}$

  

The repeating block has 6 digits, so multiply by $10^6 = 1000000$:

$$1000000x = 142857.142857...$$

  

Now subtract:

$$1000000x - x = 142857.142857... - 0.142857...$$

$$999999x = 142857$$

$$x = \frac{142857}{999999}$$

  

Simplify by finding GCD:

$$x = \frac{142857}{999999} = \frac{1}{7}$$

  

**Verification:** $\frac{1}{7} = 0.\overline{142857}$ ✓

  

**Hence, $0.\overline{142857} = \frac{1}{7}$**

  

### **Key Steps Summary:**

  

| **Step** | **Action** | **Purpose** |

|---|---|---|

| Step 1 | Let $x$ = the recurring decimal | Set up the equation |

| Step 2 | Multiply by $10^n$ where $n$ = number of repeating digits | Shift decimal point to align repeating blocks |

| Step 3 | Subtract first equation from multiplied equation | Eliminate the repeating part |

| Step 4 | Solve for $x$ | Get the fraction |

| Step 5 | Simplify the fraction | Express in lowest terms |

• How do you convert a terminating decimal to a fraction?

  

• What is the algebraic method for converting recurring decimals?

  

• Can every recurring decimal be expressed as a fraction?

  

**Extra Learning Box:**

  

The algebraic method for converting recurring decimals works because multiplication by powers of 10 shifts the decimal point, and subtraction eliminates the repeating part. This clever technique was developed by mathematicians to prove that all recurring decimals are rational numbers.

## What About Irrational Numbers?

  

**Concept**

  

Since rational numbers have only two types of decimal expansions (terminating or recurring), irrational numbers must have a different type.

  

**Irrational numbers have decimal expansions that are:**

- **Non-terminating** (they go on forever), AND

- **Non-recurring** (no repeating pattern)

  

This gives us another powerful classification tool. If a decimal continues forever without any repeating pattern, you're looking at an irrational number.

  

**Examples of irrational decimals:**

- $\sqrt{2} = 1.4142135623730950488...$

- $\pi = 3.14159265358979323846...$

- $0.101001000100001...$ (constructed with increasing zeros)

  

---

  

## Historical Perspective

  

**Concept**

  

The computation of decimal digits for famous irrational numbers has a rich history spanning millennia.

  

**Ancient Calculations:**

  

The ancient Indian mathematical text **Sulbasutras** (800-500 BCE) provided an incredibly accurate approximation for $\sqrt{2}$:

  

$$\sqrt{2} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3 \times 4} - \frac{1}{3 \times 4 \times 34} = 1.4142156...$$

  

This is accurate to five decimal places

  

The Greek mathematician **Archimedes** (287-212 BCE) calculated digits of $\pi$, showing that:

  

$$3.140845 < \pi < 3.142857$$

  

The Indian mathematician **Aryabhatta** (476-550 CE) calculated $\pi$ to be 3.1416, accurate to four decimal places.

  

In modern times, using supercomputers, mathematicians have calculated $\pi$ to over 1.24 trillion decimal places!

## Generating Irrational Numbers

  

**Concept**

  

How can we create irrational numbers? Several techniques exist:

  

### **1. Square Roots of Non-Perfect Squares**

If $n$ is not a perfect square, then $\sqrt{n}$ is irrational.

  

### **2. Constructed Decimals**

Create a decimal with a clear pattern that ensures it never repeats.

- Example: $0.101001000100001...$ (increasing number of zeros)

- Example: $0.12345678910111213...$ (consecutive integers)

  

### **3. Mathematical Constants**

Numbers like $\pi$, $e$, $\phi$ (golden ratio)

  

**Key Point:** While there may be a pattern to generate the digits, the actual decimal sequence never repeats the same block.

  

---

  

## Finding Irrationals Between Rationals

  

**Concept**

  

Given any two distinct rational numbers, infinitely many irrational numbers exist between them.

  

**Method:**

1. Convert both rationals to decimal form

2. Construct a decimal that lies between them

3. Ensure this decimal is non-terminating and non-recurring

  

**Example:** Between $\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$ and $\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}$, we can place:

- $0.26026002600026...$

- $0.27027002700027...$

- $0.3010010001...$

  

All of these are irrational and lie in the desired interval.

  

| **Rational 1** | **Decimal 1** | **Irrational (between)** | **Decimal 2** | **Rational 2** |

|---|---|---|---|---|

| $\frac{1}{4}$ | $0.25$ | $0.26026002600026...$ | $0.\overline{3}$ | $\frac{1}{3}$ |

| $\frac{2}{5}$ | $0.4$ | $0.41041004100041...$ | $0.5$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |

## Rules and Formulas

  

**Concept**

  

### **Key Properties and Theorems**

  

**1. Decimal Classification for Rationals:**

  

Every rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ (where $q \neq 0$) has a decimal expansion that is either:

- Terminating, OR

- Non-terminating recurring

  

**2. Reverse Classification:**

  

Any number with a terminating or non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed as $\frac{p}{q}$ (is rational).

  

**3. Decimal Classification for Irrationals:**

  

Every irrational number has a decimal expansion that is:

- Non-terminating, AND

- Non-recurring

  

**4. Converting Terminating Decimals:**

  

If a decimal has $n$ places:

$$\text{decimal} = \frac{\text{digits}}{10^n}$$

  

**5. Converting Single-Digit Recurring Decimals:**

  

If $x = 0.\overline{a}$, then:

$$10x - x = a \implies x = \frac{a}{9}$$

  

**6. Converting Block Recurring Decimals:**

  

If $x = 0.\overline{abc}$ (block of $n$ digits), then:

$$10^n x - x = abc \implies x = \frac{abc}{10^n - 1}$$

  

**7. Terminating Decimal Condition:**

  

$\frac{p}{q}$ (in lowest terms) has a terminating decimal **if and only if** $q = 2^m \times 5^n$ for some non-negative integers $m$ and $n$.

  

---

  

• State the condition for a fraction to have a terminating decimal.

  

• How do you convert $0.\overline{7}$ to a fraction?

  

• Can a number be both terminating and recurring? Explain.

  

**Extra Learning Box:**

  

The reason terminating decimals require denominators with only factors of 2 and 5 is because our decimal system is base-10, and $10 = 2 \times 5$. A fraction can be written with a power of 10 as denominator only if the original denominator divides some power of 10, which happens exactly when it contains only factors of 2 and 5.

  

---

  

## Examples

  

**Example 1:** Convert the following fractions to decimal form and identify whether each has a terminating or non-terminating recurring expansion: $\frac{13}{16}$, $\frac{5}{12}$, $\frac{7}{9}$

  

**Solution:**

  

**For** $\tfrac{13}{16}$:

  

Performing long division:

$$13 \div 16 = 0.8125$$

  

**Division process:**

- $130 \div 16 = 8$ remainder $2$

- $20 \div 16 = 1$ remainder $4$

- $40 \div 16 = 2$ remainder $8$

- $80 \div 16 = 5$ remainder $0$

  

Since the remainder becomes zero, this is a **terminating decimal**.

  

---

  

**For** $\tfrac{5}{12}$:

  

Performing long division:

$$5 \div 12 = 0.41666...$$

  

The division process shows:

- Remainders cycle: $5 \to 2 \to 8 \to 8 \to 8...$

- The digit 6 repeats infinitely

  

We write this as $0.41\overline{6}$

  

This is a **non-terminating recurring decimal**.

  

---

  

**For** $\tfrac{7}{9}$:

  

Performing long division:

$$7 \div 9 = 0.\overline{7}$$

  

The remainder is consistently 7, causing 7 to repeat.

  

This is a **non-terminating recurring decimal**.

  

---

  

**Final Answer:**

- $\frac{13}{16} = 0.8125$ (terminating)

- $\frac{5}{12} = 0.41\overline{6}$ (non-terminating recurring)

- $\frac{7}{9} = 0.\overline{7}$ (non-terminating recurring)

  

---

  

**Example 2:** Express $0.454545...$ (which we write as $0.\overline{45}$) in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$.

  

**Solution:**

  

Let $x = 0.454545...$

  

Notice that the repeating block "45" has 2 digits. To eliminate the repeating part, multiply by $10^2 = 100$:

  

$$100x = 45.454545...$$

  

Observe that:

$$100x = 45 + 0.454545... = 45 + x$$

  

This is the key step! The decimal part of $100x$ is the same as the original $x$.

  

Now solve for $x$:

$$100x = 45 + x$$

  

Subtract $x$ from both sides:

$$100x - x = 45$$

$$99x = 45$$

  

Divide both sides by 99:

$$x = \frac{45}{99}$$

  

Simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCD, which is 9:

$$x = \frac{45 \div 9}{99 \div 9} = \frac{5}{11}$$

  

**Verification:** $\frac{5}{11} = 0.\overline{45}$

  

**Final Answer:** $0.\overline{45} = \frac{5}{11}$

  

---

  

**Example 3:** Convert $2.36\overline{8}$ (which means $2.36888...$) to a fraction.

  

**Solution:**

  

Let $x = 2.36888...$

  

Here we have:

- Two digits (36) after the decimal that don't repeat

- One digit (8) repeats infinitely

  

**Strategy:** Multiply by appropriate powers of 10 to handle both parts.

  

$$x = 2.36888...$$

  

Multiply by 10:

$$10x = 23.6888...$$

  

Multiply by 100:

$$100x = 236.888...$$

  

Now subtract:

$$100x - 10x = 236.888... - 23.6888...$$

$$90x = 213.2$$

  

Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimal:

$$900x = 2132$$

  

$$x = \frac{2132}{900}$$

  

Simplify by finding GCD(2132, 900) = 4:

$$x = \frac{2132 \div 4}{900 \div 4} = \frac{533}{225}$$

  

**Final Answer:** $2.36\overline{8} = \frac{533}{225}$

  

---

  

**Example 4:** Find two irrational numbers between $\frac{2}{9}$ and $\frac{3}{9}$.

  

**Solution:**

  

First, convert these fractions to decimal form:

$$\frac{2}{9} = 0.222... = 0.\overline{2}$$

$$\frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.333... = 0.\overline{3}$$

  

We need irrational numbers between $0.\overline{2}$ and $0.\overline{3}$.

  

To create an irrational number:

1. It must lie between these two values

2. It must be non-terminating

3. It must be non-recurring

  

**First irrational number:**

$$0.230230023000230000...$$

  

This decimal has a pattern (increasing zeros between "23"), but never repeats the same block.

  

**Second irrational number:**

$$0.24024002400024000002...$$

  

Again, increasing zeros ensure it never repeats, making it irrational.

  

**Verification:**

- $0.222... < 0.230230023... < 0.333...$

- $0.222... < 0.24024002... < 0.333...$

- Both are non-terminating, non-recurring

  

**Final Answer:** $0.230230023000...$ and $0.24024002400024...$

  

---

  

**Example 5:** Show that $1.999999...$ (which we write as $1.\overline{9}$) equals 2.

  

**Solution:**

  

Let $x = 1.999999...$

  

Since one digit (9) repeats, multiply by 10:

$$10x = 19.99999...$$

  

Subtract the first equation from the second:

$$10x - x = 19.9999... - 1.9999...$$

$$9x = 18$$

$$x = \frac{18}{9} = 2$$

  

This proves that $1.\overline{9} = 2$!

  

**Interpretation:** This seems strange, but it's mathematically rigorous. The infinitely repeating 9's mean we're approaching 2 as a limit. In the real number system, $1.999...$ and $2$ are the same number, just written differently.

  

**Final Answer:** $1.\overline{9} = 2$

  

---

  

**Example 6:** Classify the following numbers as having terminating, non-terminating recurring, or non-terminating non-recurring decimal expansions: $\sqrt{16}$, $\sqrt{15}$, $\frac{8}{125}$, $\frac{7}{15}$, $0.345345...$

  

**Solution:**

  

**For** $\sqrt{16}$:

$$\sqrt{16} = 4 = 4.0$$

  

This is a whole number. **Classification: Terminating (rational)**

  

---

  

**For** $\sqrt{15}$:

  

Since $15$ is not a perfect square, $\sqrt{15}$ is irrational.

$$\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872983346207417...$$

  

**Classification: Non-terminating, non-recurring (irrational)**

  

---

  

**For** $\frac{8}{125}$:

  

Note that $125 = 5^3$. Since the denominator contains only the prime factor 5, this will terminate.

$$\frac{8}{125} = \frac{8}{5^3} = \frac{64}{1000} = 0.064$$

  

**Classification: Terminating (rational)**

  

---

  

**For** $\frac{7}{15}$:

  

The denominator $15 = 3 \times 5$. Since it contains prime factor 3 (other than 2 or 5), this will not terminate.

  

Performing division:

$$\frac{7}{15} = 0.4666... = 0.4\overline{6}$$

  

**Classification: Non-terminating recurring (rational)**

  

---

  

**For** $0.345345...$:

  

This is written as $0.\overline{345}$. The block "345" repeats infinitely.

  

**Classification: Non-terminating recurring (rational)**

  

---

  

**Final Answer:**

- $\sqrt{16}$: Terminating

- $\sqrt{15}$: Non-terminating, non-recurring

- $\frac{8}{125}$: Terminating

- $\frac{7}{15}$: Non-terminating recurring

- $0.345345...$: Non-terminating recurring

## When Do Decimals Terminate?

  

**Concept**

  

An important question: Can we predict whether a fraction will have a terminating decimal without actually performing the division?

  

**Answer: Yes!**

  

**Theorem:** A fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ in lowest terms has a terminating decimal **if and only if** the denominator $q$ has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.

  

In other words, $q$ must be of the form $q = 2^m \times 5^n$ where $m$ and $n$ are non-negative integers.

  

**Why does this work?**

  

Our decimal system is base-10, and $10 = 2 \times 5$. A fraction can be written with a power of 10 as denominator only if the original denominator divides some power of 10.

  

| **Fraction** | **Denominator Factorization** | **Terminates?** | **Why?** |

|---|---|---|---|

| $\frac{3}{8}$ | $8 = 2^3$ | Yes | Only factor 2 |

| $\frac{7}{20}$ | $20 = 2^2 \times 5$ | Yes | Only factors 2 and 5 |

| $\frac{5}{12}$ | $12 = 2^2 \times 3$ | No | Contains factor 3 |

| $\frac{11}{30}$ | $30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5$ | No | Contains factor 3 |

| $\frac{13}{50}$ | $50 = 2 \times 5^2$ | Yes | Only factors 2 and 5 |
