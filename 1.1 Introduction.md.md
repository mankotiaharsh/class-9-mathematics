**Concept**

  

A **rational number** is any number that can be expressed in the form $\tfrac{p}{q}$, where:

- $p$ and $q$ are integers ($p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$)

- $q \neq 0$ (the denominator cannot be zero)

- The fraction is typically expressed in its simplest form where $\gcd(p, q) = 1$

  

**Examples of Rational Numbers:**

- $\tfrac{3}{4}$ (a proper fraction)

- $-\tfrac{5}{2}$ (a negative rational number)

- $7 = \tfrac{7}{1}$ (every integer is rational)

- $0 = \tfrac{0}{1}$ (zero is rational)

- $0.5 = \tfrac{1}{2}$ (terminating decimals are rational)

- $0.\overline{3} = \tfrac{1}{3}$ (repeating decimals are rational)

  

**What are Irrational Numbers?**

  

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a simple fraction $\tfrac{p}{q}$. When you convert them to decimals, they go on forever without repeating any pattern. For example, $\pi = 3.14159...$ never ends and never repeats. You cannot write $\sqrt{2}$ as a fraction, no matter how hard you try! These "non-fractional" numbers are called irrational numbers.

  

**Examples of Irrational Numbers:**

  

- $\sqrt{2}$ (cannot be expressed as $\tfrac{p}{q}$)

- $\pi$ (the ratio of circumference to diameter)

- $e$ (Euler's number)

## Geometric Construction of Irrational Numbers

  

**Concept**

  

While rational numbers can be expressed as fractions, irrational numbers like √2, √3, and √x (for any positive non-perfect square x) can be constructed geometrically using the Pythagorean theorem.

  

### **Constructing √x on the Number Line**

  

For any positive real number x, we can find √x geometrically:

  

1. Mark point B such that AB = x units on a horizontal line

2. Mark point C such that BC = 1 unit  

3. Find the midpoint O of AC, so AO = OC = (x+1)/2

4. Draw a semicircle with center O and radius OA

5. Draw a perpendicular from B to intersect the semicircle at point D

6. The length BD = √x

  

**Mathematical Proof:**

- Triangle OBD is a right triangle with right angle at B

- OA = OD = (x+1)/2 (radii of the circle)

- OB = x - (x+1)/2 = (x-1)/2

- By Pythagorean theorem: BD² = OD² - OB² = ((x+1)/2)² - ((x-1)/2)² = x

- Therefore, BD = √x

  

This construction proves that irrational numbers have real geometric meaning and can be precisely located on the number line.

## Representing Irrational Numbers on the Number Line

  

**Concept**

  

The number line is "dense" with both rational and irrational numbers. While rational numbers can be expressed as fractions, irrational numbers fill the "gaps" between them.

  

### **Locating √2 on the Number Line**

  

1. Construct a right triangle with legs of length 1 unit each

2. The hypotenuse has length √2 ≈ 1.414...

3. Use a compass to mark this distance on the number line

  

This geometric approach shows that irrational numbers are not just abstract concepts—they have precise positions on the number line and real geometric significance.

  

### **Key Insight**

  

Every point on the number line corresponds to either a rational or irrational number. Together, rational and irrational numbers form the set of **real numbers** (ℝ).

  

More generally, to find $\sqrt{x}$, for any positive real number $x$, we mark $B$ so that $AB = x$ units, and mark $C$ so that $BC = 1$ unit. Then, as we have done for the case $x = 3.5$, we find $BD = \sqrt{x}$. We can prove this result using the Pythagoras Theorem.

  

![image](https://d2wz5rhjp6ty7q.cloudfront.net/CBSE_9_IMAGES/Mathematics_9/d76db04d4989442ca8e2d20c2e654318.png)

  

Notice that, in the aboce figure, $AOB D$ is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle is $\frac{x + 1}{2}$ units.

  

Therefore, $OC = OD = OA = \frac{x + 1}{2}$ units.

  

Now, $OB = x - \left(\frac{x + 1}{2}\right) = \frac{x - 1}{2}$.

  

So, by the Pythagoras Theorem, we have

  

$$BD^2 = OD^2 - OB^2 = \left(\frac{x + 1}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x - 1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{4x}{4} = x.$$

  

This shows that $BD = \sqrt{x}$.

  

This construction gives us a visual, and geometric way of showing that $\sqrt{x}$ exists for all real numbers $x > 0$. If you want to know the position of $\sqrt{x}$ on the number line, then let us treat the line $BC$ as the number line, with $B$ as zero, $C$ as 1, and so on.

Draw an arc with centre $B$ and radius $BD$, which intersects the number line in $E$. Then, $E$ represents $\sqrt{x}$ as shown in the above figure.

## Types of Numbers

  

**Concept**

  

Imagine walking along an endless line marked with numbers. Starting at zero and heading right, you pass points labeled 1, 2, 3, and so on—these are the **natural numbers**.  

  

If you gather these together, you have the set $N$. Turning back, you pick up zero and add it to your collection, forming the **whole numbers** $W$. Continuing left, you collect –1, –2, –3, creating the set of **integers** $Z$.  

  

Yet, even after gathering all integers, many more numbers remain—fractions like $\tfrac{1}{2}$ or decimals like 0.75. These belong to the **rational numbers** $Q$.

### **Natural Numbers (N)**

  

Defined as {1, 2, 3, …}. They represent simple counting.

  

### **Whole Numbers (W)**

  

Includes all natural numbers plus zero: {0, 1, 2, 3, …}.

  

### **Integers (Z)**

  

Adds negative counterparts: {…, –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}.

  

### **Rational Numbers (Q)**

  

Numbers expressible as $\tfrac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \in Z$ and $q \neq 0$. Every integer is rational since $m = \tfrac{m}{1}$.

## Why Multiple Representations?

  

**Concept**

  

A single rational number can be written in many forms:

$$\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{2}{4} = \tfrac{10}{20} = \tfrac{25}{50}.$$

  

When marking $\tfrac{1}{2}$ on the number line, we choose the simplest co-prime form $\tfrac{1}{2}$

## Finding Rational Numbers Between Two Values    # Corrected

  

**Concept**

  

Between any two rationals, infinitely many others exist. For example, to find one number between $r$ and $s$, compute $\tfrac{r + s}{2}$.

  

Between 1 and 2: $\tfrac{1 + 2}{2} = \tfrac{3}{2}$.  

  

To find five numbers at once, rewrite endpoints with a common denominator of 6:

$$1 = \tfrac{6}{6}, \quad 2 = \tfrac{12}{6}.$$

  

Then $\tfrac{8}{6}, \tfrac{9}{6}, \tfrac{10}{6}, \tfrac{11}{6}$ lie between 1 and 2

  
  

## Examples

  

**Example 1:** Determine whether each statement is true or false. Provide reasons.

  

1. Every whole number is a natural number.

2. Every integer is a rational number.

3. Every rational number is an integer.

  

**Solution:**

  

1. **False.** Zero is whole but not natural.  

2. **True.** Any integer $m$ equals $\tfrac{m}{1}$.  

3. **False.** $\tfrac{3}{5}$ is not an integer.  

  

---

  

**Example 2:** Find six rational numbers between 3 and 4.

  

**Method 1: Repeatedly apply $\tfrac{r+s}{2}$**

  

Starting with 3 and 4, we find the midpoint:

$$\tfrac{3+4}{2} = \tfrac{7}{2} = 3.5.$$

  

Now we have one number. To find more, we take midpoints of smaller intervals:

  

Between 3 and 3.5: $\tfrac{3+3.5}{2} = \tfrac{6.5}{2} = 3.25$

  

Between 3.5 and 4: $\tfrac{3.5+4}{2} = \tfrac{7.5}{2} = 3.75$

  

Continuing this process:

  

Between 3 and 3.25: $\tfrac{3+3.25}{2} = 3.125$

  

Between 3.25 and 3.5: $\tfrac{3.25+3.5}{2} = 3.375$

  

Between 3.5 and 3.75: $\tfrac{3.5+3.75}{2} = 3.625$

  

**Six rational numbers:** 3.125, 3.25, 3.375, 3.5, 3.625, 3.75

  

---

  

**Method 2: Express as fractions with common denominator**

  

Convert to fractions with denominator 7:

$$3 = \tfrac{21}{7}, \quad 4 = \tfrac{28}{7}$$

  

Now we can easily choose six fractions between $\tfrac{21}{7}$ and $\tfrac{28}{7}$:

$$\tfrac{22}{7}, \tfrac{23}{7}, \tfrac{24}{7}, \tfrac{25}{7}, \tfrac{26}{7}, \tfrac{27}{7}$$

  

---

  

**Alternative Method 2 (using denominator 10):**  

$$3 = \tfrac{30}{10}, \quad 4 = \tfrac{40}{10}$$

  

Six rational numbers: $\tfrac{31}{10}, \tfrac{32}{10}, \tfrac{33}{10}, \tfrac{34}{10}, \tfrac{35}{10}, \tfrac{36}{10}$

  

Which simplifies to: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6

  

---

  

**Verification:** All these numbers satisfy $3 < \text{number} < 4$ and can be expressed as $\tfrac{p}{q}$ where $p, q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$.

## Rules Governing Rational Numbers

  

**Concept**

  

When working with rational numbers—those expressible as $\tfrac{p}{q}$ with integers $p$ and $q \neq 0$—the following foundational rules apply:

  

### **1. Denominator Non-Zero**

A rational number must have a non-zero denominator: $q \neq 0$.

  

### **2. Simplest (Lowest) Terms**

Any rational $\tfrac{p}{q}$ is customarily written in lowest terms, meaning $p$ and $q$ share no common divisor other than 1:

  

$$\gcd(p, q) = 1.$$

  

### **3. Equivalent Fractions**

Multiplying or dividing numerator and denominator by the same non-zero integer $k$ yields an equivalent rational number:

$$\frac{p}{q} = \frac{p \cdot k}{q \cdot k}, \quad \forall k \in \mathbb{Z} - \{0\}.$$                # corrected

  

### **4. Closure Under Addition and Multiplication**

The sum or product of any two rationals is always rational. For $\tfrac{a}{b}, \tfrac{c}{d}$:

$$\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}, \quad \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}.$$

  

### **5. Existence of Additive and Multiplicative Inverses**

- **Additive inverse:** Every $\tfrac{p}{q}$ has $-\tfrac{p}{q}$.

- **Multiplicative inverse:** Every nonzero $\tfrac{p}{q}$ has $\tfrac{q}{p}$.

  

> **Note:** Exception – $0$ does **not** have a multiplicative inverse, because there is no rational number $x$ such that $0 \times x = 1$.  

> For any rational number $x$, $0 \times x = 0$, never $1$.     # Corrected

  

### **6. Infinite Density**

Between any two distinct rationals $r$ and $s$, there exists another rational number. In fact, infinitely many lie between them.

  

---

  

• State the closure property for rational numbers with examples.

  

• Why can't zero have a multiplicative inverse?

  

• If two rational numbers are added, will the result always be rational? Prove with an example.

  

**Extra Learning Box:**

The **closure property** means that performing operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division by non-zero) on rational numbers always yields another rational number. This property makes rational numbers a **field** in mathematics.

## Examples Revisited

  

**Example 3:** Finding Five Fractions Between 2 and 3  

  

**Solution:**

  

Rewrite with denominator 6:

$$2 = \tfrac{12}{6}, \quad 3 = \tfrac{18}{6}.$$

  

Then $\tfrac{13}{6}, \tfrac{14}{6}, \tfrac{15}{6}, \tfrac{16}{6}, \tfrac{17}{6}$ lie between 2 and 3.

**Example 4:** Checking Closure Under Multiplication

  

**Solution:**

  

Multiply:

$$\tfrac{3}{4} \times \tfrac{5}{6} = \tfrac{15}{24} = \tfrac{5}{8},$$

which remains rational.

**Example 5:** Verifying Multiplicative Inverse  

  

**Solution:**

  

The inverse of $\tfrac{-7}{3}$ is $\tfrac{3}{-7} = -\tfrac{3}{7}$.

  

Verification:

$$\tfrac{-7}{3} \times \left(-\tfrac{3}{7}\right) = \tfrac{21}{21} = 1$$

  

---

  

**Example 6:** Geometric Verification of Irrationality

  

**Problem:** Use geometric construction to show that √2 cannot be expressed as a simple fraction.

  

**Solution:**

  

The geometric construction shows that √2 is the exact length of the hypotenuse of a unit square. This length cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, which can be proven by contradiction:

  

Assume √2 = p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors.

Then 2 = p²/q², so 2q² = p².

This means p² is even, so p must be even. Let p = 2k.

Then 2q² = 4k², so q² = 2k².

This means q² is even, so q must be even.

But if both p and q are even, they have a common factor of 2, contradicting our assumption.

  

Therefore, √2 is irrational and can only be represented geometrically.
